# Module-14
JavaScript - Belly Button Challenge
## Resources
For this challenege, in addition to the resources provided by the instructional, the class activities and a reference guide for which activity corresponded to which section of the assignment, I also utilized online resources listed below. It was quite fun to experiment with all the different colour codes. Customizing the background colours to match what was already provided for the layout of the webpage.
Collaborating with other classmates during weekly study sessions continues to be a tremendous asset. The tutor sessions as well as the learning assitants from askBCS are extremely knowledgable and are always helpful. We covered the use of variables declared by "let" in the majority of the class activities, however during one-on-one tutorials, I learned the difference between the two. Using "var" for declaring variables instead of "let", allows the variable to be available througout the function in which they are declared, rather than only being available inside the block in which they're defined.
I also chose to create the dropdown menu panel first, and created all the charts after. Though the instructions stated otherwise. I wanted to ensure that the selector would in fact filter through the JSON data samples to appear correctly before continuing.
